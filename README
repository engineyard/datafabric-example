This is a demo of the DataFabric gem for MySQL.  Two shards are used.  Each shard is
a master/slave pair.  MySQL native replication is used between each master/slave database
so these must be on different servers.  An additional, non-sharded, non-replicated MySQL
database is used for tables not configured to go into the shards.  With this setup and
some very simple GUI testing, the basic functionality of the gem has been validated.
